# RadioHead

This is the RadioHead Packet Radio library for embedded microprocessors. 
It provides a complete object-oriented library for sending and receiving packetized messages via a variety of common data radios and other transports on a range of embedded microprocessors.

You can find the latest version of the documentation at http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/arduino/RadioHead

This repository contains the different versions of the RadioHead library from version 1.74 until now.

This repository makes it easier for developers to access RadioHead so that they can offer improvements.

I am currently working on the branch [piduino](https://github.com/epsilonrt/RadioHead/tree/piduino) to port this library on all 
Pi boards (Raspberry Pi, Nano Pi, Orange Pi ...) thanks to the library [piduino](https://github.com/epsilonrt/piduino).
